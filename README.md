Analyzing Code Smell Relationships
This project contains code examples demonstrating how refactoring one code smell can introduce a new one. The goal is to analyze and understand these relationships to perform more effective refactoring.

Background
Refactoring code to fix smells can often inadvertently introduce new smells. This makes it challenging to improve code quality through refactoring.

This project aims to build awareness of common smell relationships by providing concrete examples.

Contents
The experiments folder contains subdirectories named after the smell relationships. For example:

experiments/Data Clumps_Extract Class_Lazy Class

Contributing
